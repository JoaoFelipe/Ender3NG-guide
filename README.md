# Ender 3 NG Guide

This is an unofficial guide on how to build the Ender 3 NG. The Ender 3 NG was designed by RH3D as a full transformation of the Ender 3 into a Core XY printer. All the models of Ender 3 NG are available on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy).

This guide has 5 parts:

1. [Bottom frame](1.bottom/bottom.md)
2. [Electronics enclosure](2.electronics/electronics.md)
3. [Bed](3.bed/bed.md)
4. [Top frame](4.top/top.md)
5. [Hotend/Extruder](5.hotend-extruder/hotend-extruder.md)

## Changelog

- 2023-09-15 - Initial version

## Disclaimers

I (@JoaoFelipe) made this guide based on the [.step file](https://ko-fi.com/s/f1be48e43a) to prepare myself to build the printer. The .step (and thus this guide) may be outdated, since the printer is currently in beta.

Moreover, I did not finish building the printer, so this guide may not properly work on some parts.

Finally, I may stop updating this repository once I finish building the printer. Feel free to fork it, extend it, and create your own versions of it - the license of the guide is CC0. Nonetheless, issues and pull requests are welcome too while the repository is still active.
