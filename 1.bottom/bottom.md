# Bottom

Bottom frame and Z lift. 

![Expected result](bottom.png)

Note:  In the previous version of this guide, installing the rear frame ([G16](#g16---install-the-rear-frames)) was part of [Electronics/G6](../3.electronics/electronics.md#g6---attach-side-frame). It was moved here because there are 4 alternatives of rear frames, and installing the aluminium ones on the electronics enclosure without guidance would be challenging. If you are using alternative RF.A, it maybe better to attach the side frame to the electronics enclosure before attaching it to the bottom frame, as suggested before (during Electronics/G6). Here are the alternatives of rear frames:

- Alternative RF.A (default): printed version
- Alternative RF.B: 2x 350mm 2040 aluminium extrusion
- Alternative RF.C: 2x 300mm 2040 aluminium extrusion
- Alternative RF.D: 2x 310mm 2040 aluminium extrusion

<img src="eng_brre3.png" alt="ENG-BRRE3" height="200"/>

Each part has 2 standard M5 heat inserts, as you can see above. (Note, this is a guess from me based on the size of the holes - the .step file does not have these inserts. You may be able to have inserts on the top holes too, but the hole diameter is smaller and I suggest to use bigger screws, as you can see on the step 4B.1).

#### H4 - ENG-BZB

Bottom frame Z lift B.

<img src="eng_bzb.png" alt="ENG-BZB" height="200"/>

## G - Guide

#### G1 - Get corners

For the front, use parts ENG-BLFA, and ENG-BRFA.

For the rear, it varies according to the rear frame alternative:
- RF.A: ENG-BLR, ENG-BRR
- RF.B: ENG-BLR_2040_350, ENG-BRR_2040_350
- RF.C: ENG-BLR_2040_300, ENG-BRR_2040_300
- RF.D: ENG-BLR_2040_310, ENG-BRR_2040_310

<img src="step1.png" alt="Step 1" height="300"/>

The figure shows RF.A.

#### G2 - Install 4040 Base Frames to the sides

Use 14 M5x12 screws.

<img src="step2.png" alt="Step 2" height="300"/>


#### G3 - Install 2020 Top Cross Frame to the front

Use 4 M5x25 screws.

<img src="step3.png" alt="Step 3" height="300"/>

#### G4 - Install bed aluminum extrusion to the back

The steps here are different if you have an OG Ender 3 or an Ender 3 Pro.

#### G4A - Ender 3 Pro

This version is easier to install. You just need to use 8 M5x12 to install the bed frame to the back.

<img src="step4a.png" alt="Step 4a" height="300"/>

Try to make the screw holes on the back closer to right.

#### G4B - OG Ender 3

I'm not entirely sure on how to install this version, so it is more a guess than something that I could understand from the .step file.

It neeeds 3 additional printed parts: ENG-BLRE3, ENG-BRRE3, and ENG-BZE3.

#### G4B.1 - Install ENG-BLRE3 and ENG-BRRE3

The first step is to install these adapters. The .step file does not distinguish the screw in this case, so it may be possible to use 8 M5x12 (that is what was planned for Ender 3 Pro).

<img src="step4b1.png" alt="Step 4b1" height="300"/>

However, I think it may be better to use 4 bigger screws (M5x25) attached to the top frame and 4 M5x12 attached to the bottom holes of these parts.

If you go with this suggestion, do not fully screw the top holes yet. Do it in the next step.

<img src="step4b1a.png" alt="Step 4b1" height="300"/>

#### G4B.2 - Install the 2040 Aluminum extrusion

Use 4 M4x8 screws and 4 M4 T-nuts.

<img src="step4b2.png" alt="Step 4b2" height="300"/>

#### G4B.3 - Install ENG-BZE in the middle to hold the Z lead screw

Use 4 M4x8 and 4 M4 T-nuts.

<img src="step4b3.png" alt="Step 4b3" height="300"/>

The positioning here is tricky. You may need to change the position later, to properly install the bed without binding.

#### G5 - Install feet

Use 4 M4x12 screws, 4 M4 washers, 4 rubber feet

<img src="step5.png" alt="Step 5" height="300"/>

To install, add the washer inside the rubber feet, then screw it to the corners (ENG-BLR, ENG-BRR, ENG-BLFA, and ENG-BRFA).

#### G6 - Install Z Motor mount

Use 2 M4x8 screws, 2 M4 T-nuts, and ENG-BZM

<img src="step6.png" alt="Step 6" height="300"/>

#### G7 - Install Z motor

Use 4 M3x6 and 1 Nema 17

#### G8 - Attach ENG-BZB

Once again, the steps differ for OG Ender 3 and Ender 3 Pro

#### G8A - Ender 3 Pro

Use 1 M4x40, 1 M4x8, and 1 M4 T-nut

<img src="step8a.png" alt="Step 8a" height="300"/>

#### G8B - OG Ender 3

Use 2 M4x8

<img src="step8b.png" alt="Step 8b" height="300"/>

#### G9 - Prepare leadscrews

<img src="step9.png" alt="Step 9" height="300"/>

Prepare each leadscrew by making a "sandwich" with 2 608 2RS bearings and 1 ENG-BZP in one end. To hold ENG-BZP in the leadscrew, use 4 alternating M3x10.

<img src="step9a.png" alt="Step 9a" height="300"/>

At this moment, the leadscrews may not stay in position, but the next steps should help with that.

#### G10 - Mount tensioner

<img src="step10.png" alt="Step 10" height="300"/>


This step has the following sub-steps:

#### G10.1 - Attach tensioner mount to 4040

Use 4 M4x8 and 4 M4 T-nut to mount ENG-ZBT1. Alse use 1 M3x5 on the mount to attach the spring later.

<img src="step10.1.png" alt="Step 10.1" height="300"/>

#### G10.2 - Mount tensioner arm

Use 1 M3x5 on the arm (ENG-ZBT2) to hold the spring. Put the spring in place and mount the tensioner with 1 M5x35.

<img src="step10.2.png" alt="Step 10.2" height="300"/>

Note that we haven't added the bearings to the tensioner yet. This is on purpose: we will add it after installing the GT2 belt.

#### G11 - Insert the closed loop GT2 belt

<img src="step11.png" alt="Step 11" height="300"/>

Insert the belt paying attention to the path.

#### G12 - Close Rear Z leadscrew with ENG-BZA

Use 3 M4x35 to attach ENG-BZA to ENG-BZB.

To attach to the rear frame, the attachment changes according to the source printer:

- Ender 3 Pro: use 1 M4x8, 1 M4 T-nut, and 1 M4x40
- OG Ender 3: use 2 M4x8, 2 M4 T-nut

The figure below shows Ender 3 Pro.

<img src="step12.png" alt="Step 12" height="300"/>

#### G13 - Close Front Z leadscrews with ENG-BLFB and ENG-BRFB

For each leadscrew, use 3 M4x12 and 1 M4x35

<img src="step13a.png" alt="Step 13 - M4x12" height="300"/>
<img src="step13b.png" alt="Step 13 - M4x35" height="300"/>

#### G14 - Add two bearing systems to Z belt

Attach one of the them to ENG-BZA/ENG-BZB using 1 M5x35 screw and the other to the tensioner mount (ENG-ZBT1/ENG-ZBT2) using 1 M5x20.

<img src="step14.png" alt="Step 14" height="300"/>
 
To prepare each bearing system, start with 1 M5 washer, then add 2 F695 bearings, then add another 1 M5 washer and close it with the M5 screw.

<img src="step14b.png" alt="Bearing" height="300"/>

In this figure, the washers are blue.

#### G15 - Add Linear Rods

Insert linear rods and close set each of them in position with 1 M4x8 grubscrew.

<img src="step15.png" alt="Step 15" height="300"/>

#### G16 - Install the Rear Frames

The installation changes according to the desired rear frame

#### G16:RF.A - Printed version of Rear Frames

For each side, use 4 M4x16 to attach ENG-FTL/ENG-FTR to ENG-BRL/ENG-BRR. 

<img src="step16rfa.png" alt="Step 16:RF.A" height="300"/>

#### G16:RF.B - 350mm 2040 aluminium extrusion version of rear frames

For each side, use 4 M4 T-nut and 4 M4x8 to attach 2040 aluminium extrusion to ENG-BRL_2040_350/ENG-BRR_2040_350
